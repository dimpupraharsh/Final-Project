# Image Captioning Using CNNs and LSTMs

Project Overview

This project explores the development of an image captioning system that generates textual descriptions for images by integrating Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), specifically Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. The primary goal is to merge computer vision and natural language processing to automatically describe images. Various pretrained architectures, including DenseNet201, VGG16, ResNet50, InceptionV3, and EfficientNetB0, serve as the backbone for image feature extraction. The text generation pipeline utilizes LSTM, Bidirectional LSTM, and basic RNN architectures to generate meaningful and contextually accurate captions.

The Flickr8k dataset, comprising 8000 images and five captions per image, is employed to train and evaluate the model. The project incorporates beam search strategies for decoding captions, various data preprocessing techniques, and evaluation metrics such as BLEU, CIDEr, METEOR, and ROUGE.

Key Features

Image Feature Extraction: Pretrained CNN models (VGG16, ResNet50, InceptionV3, EfficientNetB0, DenseNet201) provide image embeddings, forming the foundation of the captioning pipeline.

Caption Generation: LSTM, Bidirectional LSTM, and basic RNN models are used to generate captions from extracted image features.

Beam Search Decoding: Beam search improves caption generation by selecting the most likely word sequences, enhancing the quality of output captions.

Hyperparameter Tuning: GridSearchCV fine-tunes model parameters, including the optimizer, dropout rate, and LSTM units, to improve performance.

Evaluation Metrics: Performance is assessed using BLEU (Bilingual Evaluation Understudy), CIDEr (Consensus-based Image Description Evaluation), METEOR (Metric for Evaluation of Translation with Explicit ORdering), and ROUGE (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation).

Data Preprocessing: Caption data is preprocessed by tokenizing, converting to lowercase, removing special characters, trimming extra spaces, and filtering single-character words.

Custom Data Generator: A custom data generator (CustomDataGenerator) loads data in batches to accommodate memory limitations and facilitate large-scale model training.

Model Optimization: Dropout and early stopping prevent overfitting and enhance the model's generalization
